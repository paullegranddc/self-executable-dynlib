# POC of an executable rust shared lib

For now only work on linux x86 and aarch64

To build

```
./build.sh build <target>
```

This will produce two objects in the `./build` directory

* `libself_executable_dynlib.so`, a shared library that should also be executable

* `main_bin` a binary dynamically linked to `libself_executable_dynlib`, that call into it to fork and
execute itself

Run with 

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="./build:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ./build/main_bin
```
